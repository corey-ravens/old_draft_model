Pivot the 40, 20, and 10 Times so you can get Flying 10 and 20
from the same run.  You want to avoid taking his best 40, and
his best 20 from different runs to calculate his best flying 20.
Also pivot his other runs (Shuttles, etc.) so you can calculate
the advanced measurables.

Pivot the measures in a separate table (because you want MAXes
not MINs) and then join those, along with weight, to the above
pivot.  

When you join the tables together, bear in mind that the runs
will have more than one workout_type_for_models (because they
will have electronic times, too).  Since the measures (weight,
height, hand size) will only have handheld times, there will 
be duplicate rows for all of those (since they join to both 
the electronic and hand times).  That's the reason for the 
CASE statement in the join step.

You want to join the measures onto every attempt of the runs, 
but you need to be careful to not double count them later

If a player has two MEASURES of the same value, does he have duplicates during the pivot?
May need to try adding a second step that just does a group by and a max to get one row per max

Create a temp table for each of the measurables. By doing it
this way you can have a normalized table in the end.

For the variables that pull from multiple different drills
(like Lateral Agility Score using 40 and Shuttle) just use
the overall MIN or MAX without regard for Electronic or 
Handheld.  Because the drills are timed by hand, we decided
to allow the use of hand timed 40 for consistency.  Also, 
all of these default to 1 for the "attempt" variable.

If you decide to change this in the future (or if they start 
timing the drills electronically) you will have to add
reliability as a variable in those tables.

Create the Run Measurables Table for finding the averages. 

Because of the way you are now handling the order, you need to join 
the weight back in on workout ID, because it may not have the same
order by variable as the others.  You want the weight and the time
to come from the same workout.

The reason you have to join weight in on a separate table is there is 
no such thing as an "Indy Electronic" or "Other Electronic" weight.
Because the weight is handheld, if you pivot with weight the electronic 
times will not have an associated weight.

Create the mean and standard deviations for each weight bucket.
For the dashes, the buckets range from 3 to 7 pounds wide, depending
on sample sizes.  

Instead of just creating a 5 (or 3 or 7) pound bucket that each weight 
falls into, for every individual weight create a bucket that includes 
the 2 (or 1 or 3) pounds above and below.

Create the Run Measurables Table for creating player z scores.
Keep the players' best times for ever given workout_type_for_models.

Because we aren't as interested the actual time as his time/weight z score, 
we want the lowest of those, not necessarily the lowest raw time.

The reason you have to join weight in on a separate table is there is 
no such thing as an "Indy Electronic" or "Other Electronic" weight.
Because the weight is handheld, if you pivot with weight the electronic 
times will not have an associated weight.

Create the Non-Run Measurables Table for finding the averages. 

Some are bucketed by position (hand size), some are bucketed by 
more than one position (weight) so that you can easily move a player 
back and forth between positions (in case you have a safety and you
want to project him as a LB), others are bucketed by other factors.

You join in weight in a second step for the same reason as 
the above sections that pivot workout data similarly.

The reason we don't just take all the weights to get a weight z score
is because we can't say universally whether it is better to be heavier
or lighter.  Because if you just use the weights joined on to their 
best workouts, you will double count for some players, add the 
case statement in the table to create the averages so it only takes
one weight per player.

Create the Non-Run Measurables Table. Some are bucketed by position
(hand size), some are bucketed by more than one position (weight)
so that you can easily move a player back and forth between positions
(in case you have a safety and you want to project him as a LB), 
others are bucketed by other factors.

You join in weight in a second step for the same reason as 
the above sections that pivot workout data similarly.
